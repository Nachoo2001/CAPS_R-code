## Research Context & Motivation

### Democratic Imperative

In democratic contexts, social policy acceptability constitutes a **sine qua non condition** for co-constructing public policies that are:

-   Not only **efficient and equitable**
-   But also **democratically acceptable** to the general public

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Central Problematic

**How, for whom, and why do different social policies garner public support?**

*Example: Carbon tax and Gilets Jaunes crisis - demonstration of importance of designing policies that are not only effective but also acceptable*

## Research Questions

### Primary Research Question

**What are the determinants of social policy acceptability?**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Specific Research Dimensions

**To what extent do the following moderate social policy acceptability:**

1.  **Implicit judgments** about characteristics of beneficiary groups
2.  **Specific nature** of the social policy instrument
3.  **Perceptions of macroeconomic context**

**And for whom do these mechanisms operate?**

## Theoretical Framework

### Interdisciplinary Convergence

**Integration of three analytical perspectives:**

-   **Political Economy**: cost-benefit calculations and macro context
-   **Psychology**: moral judgments and cognitive heuristics\
-   **Sociology**: socio-economic positions and ideological orientations

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Political Economy Approach

**Core Principle:** Actors balance **perceived macroeconomic costs** of policies against **anticipated social benefits**

**Identified Mechanisms:**

-   Perceived benefits depend on **inferred capacity** of beneficiaries to make good use of aid
-   Calculations influenced by **perceived macroeconomic context**
-   When austerity perceived as inevitable → reduced support for redistribution (Blyth, 2013)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Psychological Approach: "Deservingness"

**Core Principle:** Not all vulnerable groups are judged as equally **deserving**

**Mobilized Heuristics:**

-   **Morality** of beneficiaries
-   **Work ethic**
-   **Degree of control** over their situation of vulnerability

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Empirical Hierarchy of Deservingness

**Established Pattern:**

-   **"Deserving" groups**: elderly, disabled persons
-   **"Less deserving" groups**: unemployed, immigrants

**Based on perceived:**

-   Control over situation

-   Moral character

-   Reciprocity potential

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Theoretical Convergence: Information

### Common Ground

**Both approaches emphasize:** Crucial importance of **information** in forming acceptability judgments

**Central Hypothesis:** Correcting erroneous perceptions can modify social policy acceptability

**Key insight:** Whether from cost-benefit or intuitive judgment perspective, providing information about policy effectiveness or beneficiary merit represents a promising approach

## Focus: Mus et al. (2024)

### Major Empirical Contribution

**Study Object:** Impact of misperceptions on support for cash transfers

**Experimental Design:**

-   Perception correction: *"Low-income households don't spend more on alcohol/tobacco when receiving transfers."*

-   Information based on 19 international scientific studies

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Mus et al.: Contrasting Results

**United Kingdom:** Significant increase in acceptability after correction

**France:** No significant effect despite 37% holding erroneous perceptions

**Puzzle:** Why does information work in UK but not France?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Mus et al.: Identified Limitations

1.  **No distinction** according to beneficiary profiles
2.  **Underlying mechanisms** of French ineffectiveness not elucidated\
3.  **Other psychological barriers** not investigated

## Our Contribution

### Extension of Mus et al. Paradigm

**Theoretical and Methodological contributions:**

-   **Variation in beneficiary profiles** (deservingness dimension)

-   **Additional dimension**: perceived control over situation

-   New category – **Children**: absent from deservingness literature

-   Change of *policy instrument*

-   Investigation of how **macroeconomic contexts** can moderate the effects

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Experimental Design Overview

### Sequential Three-Stage Experimental Approach

**Objective:** Identify **causal effects** of acceptability factors

**Population(s):** **France**: ELIPSS Panel (representative probability sample)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## General Architecture

1.  **STAGE 1**: Merit hierarchy and perception correction
2.  **STAGE 2**: Policy instrument acceptability
3.  **STAGE 3**: Macroeconomic context impact (austerity treatment)

## Stage 1: Merit Hierarchy

### Descriptive Component

**Measure acceptability of cash transfers for 5 groups:**

-   Elderly persons
-   Disabled persons
-   **Children** (innovation)
-   Unemployed persons
-   Immigrants

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stage 1: Experimental Component

**Randomized informational treatment on two dimensions:**

1.  **Transfer usage** (Mus et al. replication)
    -   *"Low-income households don't spend transfers on alcohol/tobacco"*
2.  **Perceived control** (innovation)
    -   *"Vulnerable households are rarely vulnerable by choice"*
    -   *"It would take 180 years for a child born in poverty to escape it"*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stage 1: Hypotheses

**H1a:** Traditionally deserving groups \> less deserving groups

**H1b:** Children will benefit from strong support (comparable to deserving groups)

**H2a:** Perception correction → ↑ acceptability

**H2b:** Stronger effect for initially less supported groups

## Stage 2: Policy Instruments

### 2A. Family Policies

**Systematic Comparison:**

-   **Cash transfers** vs **Services** (childcare places)
-   **Universal approach** vs **Targeting** disadvantaged populations

**4 policy combinations tested**

**Objective:** Identify which instrument(s) benefit from strongest public support

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stage 2B: Activation vs Compensation

**For each social group, choice between:**

-   **"Compensation" policies**: passive transfers
-   **"Activation" policies**: training, job support
-   

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stage 2: Hypothesis

**H3:** Policy preferences vary by group deservingness

-   **Activation preferred** for non-deserving groups
-   **Compensation acceptable** for deserving groups

**Mechanism:** Activation seen as promoting contribution to the group and global economic welfare

## Stage 3: Macroeconomic Context

### "Austerity" Treatment

**Information provided:**

-   Inflation and post-COVID budgetary problems
-   French public debt: 113% of GDP (3,305 billion €)
-   Social spending: 32% of GDP
-   Government discussions on "budget cuts"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stage 3: Hypotheses

**H4a:** Unfavorable context → ↑ support for activation policies

**H4b:** More marked effect for non-deserving groups

**H4c-H4d:** ↓ support for compensation policies (especially non-deserving groups)

**Mechanism:** Scarcity makes investment logic more appealing

## Questionnaire Structure {.smaller}

### Framing Variables (Q1-Q6)

-   **Q1**: Disability status (potential moderator)
-   **Q2-Q3**: Childcare experience + child development opinions
-   **Q4**: State responsibilities (ESS8 replication + children/immigrants items)
-   **Q5**: Perceived control scale unemployment (Jensen & Petersen, 2017)
-   **Q6**: Early childhood policy acceptability (4 modalities)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Main Experimental Block (Q7-Q8) {.smaller}

**Q7**: Perception measurement + informational treatment

-   Baseline question: *"Do low-income households spend transfers on alcohol/tobacco?"*
-   Treatment group receives correction + control information

**Q8**: Cash transfer acceptability by group (5 groups, 0-10 scales)

-   Randomized order presentation
-   Same order maintained throughout questionnaire

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Final Blocks (Q9-Q10) {.smaller}

**Q9**: Alternative Instruments - Binary choices activation/compensation for 4 vulnerable groups

**Q10**: Austerity Treatment + Repetition - Macroeconomic information - Option to revise previous responses - Repeat Q8-Q9 to measure treatment effects

## 

## Comparative Perspective

**Three welfare state regimes:**

-   **France & Germany**: Conservative welfare states
-   **United States**: Liberal welfare state

**Theoretical expectation:** Similar patterns in conservative regimes, different in liberal regime

**Innovation:** First experimental comparison across welfare regimes

## Expected Contributions

### Theoretical Innovations

1.  **Unified analytical framework** integrating political economy, psychology, sociology
2.  **Introduction of children** in deservingness analysis
3.  **Causal mechanisms** of differential acceptability
4.  **Cross-national validation** of deservingness theory

------------------------------------------------------------------------
